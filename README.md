👋🏻 Hi there

---

I’m a Full Stack Developer living and working in Thailand.

Passionate about clean code, working with the command line, and building secure, reliable applications.

### Tech Stack

I've been a PHP developer ever since I started my career not out of personal preference at first, but because it was required at work. Over time, I grew to appreciate the language, especially the elegance of object-oriented design patterns and Laravel's clean, expressive syntax. Over the past two years, I’ve become proficient in the LNMP stack, building and maintaining production ready applications.

On the frontend, I genuinely enjoy working with the React ecosystem. While I occasionally work with Vue or Angular when required, React is my primary tool of choice for building modern, responsive UIs.

Beyond coding, I also have hands-on experience with server setup, security hardening, and deploying full-stack applications from scratch.

- **LNMP Stack:** Linux, Nginx, MySQL, PHP
- **PHP Ecosystems:** PurePHP, PDO, Laravel, Inertia
- **Frontend:** React, Next.js, Tailwind CSS, ShadCn, TanStack Query, Zod
- **Others:** Node.js

### Currently Learning

- **Go (Golang):**  
  I'm exploring Go in my free time out of curiosity and passion for learning. Go's growing popularity, performance, and simplicity make it a great addition to my backend and CLI development skillset.

- **Coding Standards & Design Patterns:**  
  I enjoy reading best practices, design principles, and guides from experienced developers. I'm always looking to write clean, maintainable, and scalable code.

I'm a huge fan of the **big 3**:
- 🎮 Video Games  
- ⚽ Watching Football  
- 📺 Anime
